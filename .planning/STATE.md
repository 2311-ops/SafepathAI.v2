# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-06)

**Core value:** The SOS system must always work — a single tap or covert Silent/Duress trigger reliably delivers an immediate alert with live location to a user's designated guardians within seconds, bypassing every routine and AI pipeline.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — backend-auth-foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (backend-auth-foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 7
Status: Executing Phase 01
Last activity: 2026-07-07 — Phase 01 execution started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: - min
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: none yet
- Trend: N/A

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Followed research/SUMMARY.md's core-value-first 8-phase structure, but folded the standalone SignalR-only phase into Phase 2 (Real-Time Location) — no v1 requirement uniquely needed a separate real-time-layer phase; SOS-02's SignalR channel is delivered within Phase 3's dedicated AlertHub instead.
- Roadmap: Cross-Modal Detection (Phase 6) is sequenced before Health & Wellness (Phase 7) per research — XMOD-02 explicitly allows seeded/synthetic health data so it doesn't hard-block on the Health module.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

Carried forward from research (see .planning/research/SUMMARY.md "Research Flags" and "Gaps to Address"):

- Phase 3 (SOS): SMS-fallback provider choice (e.g. Twilio) needs a concrete decision during planning.
- Phase 4 (Geofencing): exact dwell-time/hysteresis parameters and Android's April 2026 background-location policy wording need re-verification at build time.
- Phase 5 (AI): cold-start fallback design (two-tier prediction, synthetic history seeding) needs concrete design during planning.
- Phase 6 (Duress): security-under-coercion threat modeling for the Silent/Duress secret storage is domain-specific and underspecified beyond the general pattern.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Family Groups | FAM-06: Companion/Kiosk Mode for non-smartphone family members | Deferred to v2 | Requirements definition (2026-07-06) |
